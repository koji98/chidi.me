         <p class="bio">Hey! My name is Chidi and I am a student at the University of Maryland - College Park
        majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Technology Entrepreneurship. My main technological interests
        include web development and app development.</p>
        <p class="bio">The picture to the left is the project that opened up my deep passion for programming at
        my first ever hackathon! Excuse my face in the picture, I don't know why I look so angry 	&#128579; </p>
         <!-- <h1 id="name">Chidi Udeze</h1>
         <p class="bio">From someone who used to hate to programming, to now a person who loves to tackle new challenges
         and make exciting new products in their free time, I have come a long way since the beginning of college. Originally,
         I saw computer science as a boring means to an end, but after attending my first hackathon, everything changed. There
         I was introduced to web development, app development, and hardware hacks, all of which opened up my eyes to the beauty
         of programming. What attracted me the most the posibility of bringing my ideas to fruition.</p>
         <p class="bio">I wanted to make websites, but I didn't have the skill. All I knew was the Java taught to me in CMSC131. During my winter break of last
          year, I decided to try my best to pick up the fundamentals of front-end web development. I used youtube to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. I made a few sites,
          which I thught were amazing, but now looking back I see how bad they really were. I wanted to get into the back-end as well so I could make full sites,
          but I had no idea where to start.</p>
         <p class="bio">Python, Ruby, Node.js, Scala, PHP, Java, C++, C#. There were way too many options. I was overwhelmed.</p>
           <blockquote>
            <span class="bigQuote">&ldquo;</span>
            <span id="question">Which one should I choose?</span>
            <span class="bigQuote">&rdquo;</span>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="bio">I feel as though this question runs through ever beginners mind. I didn't want to choose a "bad" language. I first started off with attempting
            to learn Python, because my roommate knew it. After a little I gave up, thinking there's no way I could do this. Then I heard Node.js was just JavaScript on
            the back-end. If I already knew JavaScript, then this may not be so bad, is what ran through my mind. Ever since then, I have devoted myself to becoming a
            JavaScript developer. I am comfortable with multiple other languages, but I primarily use JavaScript in my free time.</p> -->
