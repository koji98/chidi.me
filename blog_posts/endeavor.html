                                    College. The beginning of a future dedicated to my major, computer engineering. 
                                    Why computer engineering? Because they made money. Why else? Did I have a plan? Of course.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Work hard during "school hours", have fun outside of them.</li>
                                        <li>Graduate college with a strong GPA.</li>
                                        <li>Get a job, because who wouldn't want a computer engineer.</li>
                                        <li>Make money.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I soon found during the first few weeks of college that doing something you don't care for 
                                    will lead to failure. At least for me. I found myself struggling through my engineering classes, 
                                    passing by memorizing content and regurgitating information when exams came around, quickly forgetting all that I "learned" 
                                    afterward. I didn't like the hardware or software components of computer engineering but struggled through it simply 
                                    because I didn't want to quit. A few weeks later I found myself at a hackathon with my fraternity brother, and everything 
                                    changed. For context, a <b>hackathon</b> is a design sprint-like event where people with technical backgrounds come together, form teams, 
                                    and make cool stuff. What I saw amazed me. Detailed software apps and hardware products formed before my eyes. Honestly, 
                                    it felt like a movie scene. My fraternity brother and I built a magic mirror during that hackathon. I probably did about .5% of anything 
                                    for the project, but the effect it had on me was drastic. I wanted to build things from scratch as I saw during the hackathon.
                                    I later decided to move from computer engineering to computer science as my interest had geared toward software.

                                    As I started to become more infatuated with programming, I found myself watching
                                    videos
                                    and reading articles other developers made. These videos and articles inspired the next 
                                    steps in my journey to become a "real developer". I
                                    would always read articles with titles like "How to become a web developer in 2017"
                                    and
                                    would take down notes on the things they deemed necessary. Articles would vary about
                                    some of the necessary skills, but from a high level, they were consistent. I
                                    had no prior web development skills and only chose that path because of my
                                    fraternity brother, the person who helped me find the joy in programming. I would look at
                                    random things about HTML and CSS, and do it myself, but I felt like everything I
                                    made
                                    was trash. I found myself on YouTube a lot watching videos like "How you can land a
                                    top
                                    engineering job" & "How to go from zero to hero in web development". Some of these
                                    videos would be crash courses on how to make a project, while others just explaining
                                    different concepts necessary to enter web development. I poured hours into watching videos
                                    and reading articles, but never gained knowledge to match my time. I eventually started taking a web development course on Udemy by Colt
                                    Steele,
                                    my favorite Udemy instructor, and my journey to become a "real developer" seemed to
                                    finally start.

                                    I am starting my blog, <i>Endeavor</i>, for three reasons.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>To monitor.</b>
                                            </br>
                                            I have done a lot since I started my journey to become a "real developer", a
                                            definition that has changed with time. <i>Endeavor</i> will be a place that
                                            helps
                                            capture important moments during my journey. Important moments being both
                                            technical and non-technical, as both are extremely important in this
                                            journey. I
                                            want to capture new technologies I have used, the reasons for me using sed
                                            technologies, how I used sed technologies, and so much more. I want to
                                            review
                                            my leadership moments, my team experiences, and growth in unexpected territories I would 
                                            have never imagined being important during my initial start to becoming a
                                            "real developer".

                                            I love teaching. I was a teaching assistant for an introductory computer
                                            science
                                            course in java and processing for 3 semesters at my university and later course facilitated a class about
                                            web
                                            development with Node.js and MongoDB. I have gained a lot from blog posts
                                            and
                                            video tutorials about using a specific technology or tool. I want to
                                            give
                                            back like those who gave to me and other developers. Hopefully, my content
                                            will
                                            be able to help someone struggling to tackle a new challenge!

                                            Personally, seeing another's journey motivates me to be the best possible. I
                                            have gained a lot from seeing the circumstance others were in earlier compared to
                                            where
                                            they are. I plan to keep working hard, improving on my set of
                                            skills
                                            and learning new skills, and letting the world know about my successes
                                            and
                                            failures. I hope my experiences can help motivate the next kid dreaming of becoming a "real
                                            developer".
