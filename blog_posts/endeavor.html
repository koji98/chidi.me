                                    As I started to become more infatuated with programming, I found myself watching
                                    videos
                                    and reading articles other developers made. The videos and articles inspired me to
                                    be
                                    better and helped guide my next steps in my journey to become a "real developer". I
                                    would always read articles with titles like "How to become a web developer in 2017"
                                    and
                                    would take down notes on the things they deemed necessary. Articles would vary about
                                    some of the necessary skills, but overall, what I read was consistent at a high
                                    level. I
                                    had no prior web development skills and really only chose that path because of my
                                    roommate, the person who helped me find the joy in programming. I would look at
                                    random things about HTML and CSS, and do it myself, but I felt like everything I
                                    made
                                    was trash. I found myself on YouTube a lot watching videos like "How you can land a
                                    top
                                    engineering job" & "How to go from zero to hero in web development". Some of these
                                    videos would be crash courses on how to make a project, while others just explaining
                                    different concepts necessary to enter web development. No matter the length of the
                                    video
                                    or article I was viewing, it seemed like I never gained the amount of knowledge to
                                    match
                                    my time. I eventually started taking a web development course on Udemy by Colt
                                    Steele,
                                    my favorite Udemy instructor, and my journey to become a "real developer" seemed to
                                    finally start.

                                    I am starting my own personal blog, <i>Endeavor</i>, for three reasons.
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>
                                            <b>To monitor.</b>
                                            </br>
                                            I have done a lot since I started my journey to become a "real developer", a
                                            definition that has changed with time. <i>Endeavor</i> will be a place that
                                            helps
                                            capture important moments during my journey. Important moments being both
                                            technical and non-technical, as both are extremely important in this
                                            journey. I
                                            want to capture new technologies I have used, the reasons for me using sed
                                            technologies, how I used sed technologies, and so much more. I want to
                                            review
                                            my leadership moments, my team experiences, and growth in unexpected territories I would 
                                            have never imagined to be important during my initial start to becoming a
                                            "real developer".

                                            I love teaching. I was a teaching assistant for an introductory computer
                                            science
                                            course in java and processing for 3 semesters at my university and later course facilitated a class about
                                            web
                                            development with Node.js and MongoDB. I have gained a lot from blog posts
                                            and
                                            video tutorials regarding using a specific technology or tool. I want to
                                            give
                                            back like those who gave to me and other developers. Hopefully, my content
                                            will
                                            be able to help someone struggling to tackle a new challenge!

                                            Personally, seeing another's journey motivates me to be the best I can be. I
                                            have gained a lot from seeing the circumstance others were in compared to
                                            where
                                            they are currently. I plan to keep working hard, improving on my set of
                                            skills
                                            and learning new skills, and letting the world know about my successes
                                            and
                                            failures. I hope my experiences can help motivate the next kid dreaming of becoming a "real
                                            developer".
