                                College. The beginning of a future dedicated to my major, computer engineering. Why computer engineering? Because they made money. Why else? Did I have a plan? Of course.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Work hard during "school hours", have fun outside of them.</li>
                                    <li>Graduate college with a strong GPA.</li>
                                    <li>Get a job, because who wouldn't want a computer engineer.</li>
                                    <li>Make money.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I soon found during the first few weeks of college that doing something you don't care for will lead to failure. At least for me. I found myself struggling through my engineering classes, passing by memorizing content and regurgitating information when
                                exams came around, quickly forgetting all that I "learned" afterward. I didn't like the hardware or software components of computer engineering but struggled through it simply because I didn't want to quit. A few weeks
                                later I found myself at a hackathon with my fraternity brother, and everything changed. For context, a <b>hackathon</b> is a design sprint-like event where people with technical backgrounds
                                come together, form teams, and make cool stuff. What I saw amazed me. Detailed software apps and hardware products formed before my eyes. Honestly, it felt like a movie scene. My fraternity brother and I built a magic mirror
                                during that hackathon. I probably did about .5% of anything for the project, but the effect it had on me was drastic. I wanted to build things from scratch as I saw during the hackathon. I later decided to move from computer
                                engineering to computer science as my interest had geared toward software.

                                As I started to become more infatuated with programming, I found myself watching videos and reading articles other developers made. These videos and articles inspired the next steps in my journey to become a "real developer". I would always read articles
                                with titles like "How to become a web developer in 2017" and would take down notes on the things they deemed necessary. Articles would vary about some of the necessary skills, but from a high level, they were consistent.
                                I had no prior web development skills and only chose that path because of my fraternity brother, the person who helped me find the joy in programming. I would look at random things about HTML and CSS, and do it myself,
                                but I felt like everything I made was trash. I found myself on YouTube a lot watching videos like "How you can land a top engineering job" & "How to go from zero to hero in web development". Some of these videos would be
                                crash courses on how to make a project, while others just explaining different concepts necessary to enter web development. I poured hours into watching videos and reading articles, but never gained knowledge to match my
                                time. I eventually started taking a web development course on Udemy by Colt Steele, my favorite Udemy instructor, and my journey to become a "real developer" seemed to finally start.

                                I am starting my blog, <i>Endeavor</i>, for three reasons.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>To monitor.</b>
                                        </br>
                                        I have done a lot since I started my journey to become a "real developer", a definition that has changed with time. <i>Endeavor</i> will be a place that helps capture important moments during my journey. Important
                                        moments being both technical and non-technical, as both are extremely important in this journey. I want to capture new technologies I have used, the reasons for me using sed technologies, how I used sed technologies,
                                        and so much more. I want to review my leadership moments, my team experiences, and growth in unexpected territories I would have never imagined being important during my initial start to becoming a "real developer".
                                    </li>

                                        <b>To teach.</b>
                                        </br>
                                        I love teaching. I was a teaching assistant for an introductory computer science course in java and processing for 3 semesters at my university and later course facilitated a class about web development with Node.js and MongoDB. I have gained a lot from
                                        blog posts and video tutorials about using a specific technology or tool. I want to give back like those who gave to me and other developers. Hopefully, my content will be able to help someone struggling to tackle
                                        a new challenge!

                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <b>To inspire.</b>
                                        </br>
                                        Personally, seeing another's journey motivates me to be the best possible. I have gained a lot from seeing the circumstance others were in earlier compared to where they are. I plan to keep working hard, improving on my set of skills and learning new
                                        skills, and letting the world know about my successes and failures. I hope my experiences can help motivate the next kid dreaming of becoming a "real developer".
