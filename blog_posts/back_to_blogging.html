                                Well, its been a little over a year since my last post. It's embarrassing to see I only wrote two posts before my hiatus. Honestly, it wasn't that I didn't have much to write about, but rather didn't have the energy to do so. A lot has happened in the
                                last year for me. Here goes a quick recap:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="list-item-header">Finished My CACI Internship.</span>
                                        <br> If you read (and can remember, since its been so long) the last post, I was in the middle of an internship with CACI. I had just completed writing a software requirements document for migrating a legacy application
                                        to the cloud. I did successfully create the application, but my internship ended before I could see it deployed &#9785; I learned a lot during my time at CACI, from how government contracting worked to development
                                        with ASP.NET and C#. Development in C#/ASP.NET was a lot different from my experience with Node.js/Express or Python/Flask. I realized I'm not a big fan of opinionated frameworks. I think development did go faster
                                        when I got used to, but still disliked that a lot of the decisions weren't made by me.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="list-item-header">Started At Fulltime Job.</span>
                                        <br> I started my fulltime job as a Data Intelligence Engineer at Microsoft. The beginning was rough, but amazing. There was <b>a lot</b> to ramp-up on, but I learned so much in the process. Since then I've moved
                                        into a Data & Applied Scientist role. Data science has become a new passion of mine and I'm grateful to grow in the field at Microsoft. I can honestly say that everyday I learn something new.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <span class="list-item-header">Began An Anime Project.</span>
                                        <br> I started a new passion project, <a href="https://anibrain.ai" target="_blank">AniBrain</a>! I have watched anime since I was a kid, starting off with classics like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, and Bleach on Toonami.
                                        In searching for a new personal project to get more realistic data science/machine learning experience, I realized that the anime domain doesn't have a lot of widespread artificial intelligence usage (that I know
                                        of). I want to bring more artificial intelligence powered tools to the anime domain. This starts with a recommender system (which I've seen is <b>very</b> common to make with anime data, but I'd like to think I
                                        can make it "better"). I have a lot of other ideas and will be building them out one-by-one.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the foreseeable future, my posts will consist of work, learnings, and challenges I've met while building <a href="https://anibrain.ai" target="_blank">AniBrain</a>. I may occasionally write about my job experiences
                                as well. At this point you're probably wondering, <i>"Will you actually post again any time soon?"</i> <b>Yes,</b> I do plan on posting more consistently this time around. I thought about blogging multiple times during
                                my time at Microsoft and building <a href="https://anibrain.ai" target="_blank">AniBrain</a>, yet I never acted on it. It's a big regret of mine and I'll keep on regretting it as long as I don't, so here goes my second
                                attempt!
